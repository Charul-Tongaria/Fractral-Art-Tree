A fractal tree is a graphical representation of a tree structure that uses recursion to create branches that repeatedly split into smaller branches. Each branch is a scaled-down version of the tree itself, creating a self-similar pattern that extends infinitely. This recursive nature results in intricate and beautiful designs that are often seen in nature.

Key Features of the Fractal Tree:
1. Recursive Structure: The fractal tree is built using a recursive function that repeatedly draws branches. Each branch splits into two or more smaller branches, which in turn split into even smaller branches, and so on.

2. Angles and Lengths: The angles and lengths of the branches can be varied to create different styles of trees. By adjusting these parameters, you can simulate different types of trees, from bushy oaks to tall pines.

3. Depth of Recursion: The depth of recursion determines how many levels of branches are drawn. Higher depths create more detailed trees but require more computation.

4. Branch Color and Thickness: Colors and thicknesses of the branches can be customized to enhance the visual appeal. Gradients can be applied to give a realistic look to the tree.

5. Randomness: Adding a touch of randomness to the angles and lengths can make the tree look more natural and less symmetrical.
